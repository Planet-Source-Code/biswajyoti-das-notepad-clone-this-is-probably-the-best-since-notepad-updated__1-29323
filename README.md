### Description

This is probably the best ever clone for Windows Notepad ....

I have seen several other codes but they don;t have all the

features that the Notepad has .. for example the Word Wrap.

Putting the date , time just like Notepad does ... I mean blinking

the cursor just after the last digit in the date/time ... font changer.

Well a few more which you will see on using my prog ... I hope

you like this ...

I badly need some votes for it .... I have spent much time on it ..

I know there are some bugs .. but I hope to correct them in my next

release :-)

Thanks ........

Biswajyoti ...
